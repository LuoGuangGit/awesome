## What Is Cheat Sheet?

With the rapid development of technologies in web programming, the amount of knowledge we have to learn is increasing. And sometimes you will not be able to remember all the syntax, methods ... of a programming language or framework. So cheat sheet was born to solve the above problem. It will synthesize all syntax, concepts ... in a systematic and intuitive way that makes it easy to find what you want to apply in your web development process.
